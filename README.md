conducted extensive research to develop a highly accurate stock price
prediction model using historical Goldman Sachs stock market data
from 1999 to 2022. My research culminated in the successful
implementation of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) algorithms,
which outperformed alternative methods, including ARIMA and
Exponential Smoothing, in predicting stock prices
